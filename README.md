A backend service that provides secure user authentication, detailed logging of login activity, rate limiting, and rule-based threat detection. 

---

## Features

### Authentication
- User signup & login
- Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- JWT access + refresh tokens
- Role-based authorization (user/admin)

### Security & Logging
- Rate limiting (Redis)
- IP + User-Agent logging
